"""A signature drawn on white paper, photographed, turned into ink on glass.

The person signs on a blank sheet and uploads the picture. What comes back
is a small transparent PNG holding only the strokes, in the stamp's blue:
the paper, the shadows and the lighting are gone, so the signature can be
laid over the company stamp and printed on a bill or a purchase order as if
it had been signed there.

How: the picture is turned to greys and its contrast stretched; the paper is
found as the bright side of the histogram; anything clearly darker than the
paper is ink, and how much darker sets how opaque the pixel is, so thin
strokes keep soft edges. The result is cropped to the strokes and scaled to
a printable width.
