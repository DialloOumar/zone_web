# The dump never touches the server's disk: pg_dump runs inside the database
# container, gzip squeezes it, and the web container uploads the stream. One
# pipeline, nothing left behind to clean up or to leak.
#
# pipefail is the important line. Without it, pg_dump failing halfway leaves
# gzip finishing happily and the whole pipeline reporting success -- which is
# how a folder fills with empty files that nobody looks at until the day they
# need one. With it, the failure travels, and backup_db.py refuses anything
# too small to be real anyway.
