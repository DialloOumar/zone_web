"""Send a database dump to object storage, and thin out the old ones.

Reads the gzipped dump on standard input, so the dump is never written to the
server's disk: pg_dump runs in the database container, gzip squeezes it, and
this uploads the stream as it arrives. One pipeline, nothing left behind.

    docker compose exec -T db pg_dump ... | gzip -9 | \
        docker compose exec -T web python scripts/backup_db.py

Run it with --list to see what is stored, and --rotate-only to thin the folder
without taking a new dump.

Why it lives in the web container: the S3 credentials, the bucket and the
folder layout are already there, in s3_storage. A second copy of any of that
would be a second thing to keep in step.
